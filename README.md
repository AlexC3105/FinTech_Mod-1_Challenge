# Title: Ethereum: Pioneering Decentralization in Finance

## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?
* Ethereum.

* When was the company incorporated?
* Ethereum was proposed in late 2013, and its development was funded through a crowdsale in mid-2014. The network went live on July 30, 2015.

* Who are the founders of the company?
* Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, along with other co-founders including Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin, and Jeffrey Wilcke.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
* The idea for Ethereum came about when Vitalik Buterin, originally involved in the Bitcoin community, proposed the creation of a new platform with a more general scripting language to develop decentralized applications. Buterin sought to create a platform that was more robust and versatile than Bitcoin's scripting language, enabling a wider range of applications.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
*Ethereum's initial development was funded through a public crowdsale in 2014, raising over $18 million worth of Bitcoin. This was one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns at the time and helped to finance the project's early development. Ethereum does not operate like a traditional company; instead, it is decentralized, with ongoing developments funded by the Ethereum Foundation, grants, and community contributions.

## Expansion for Clarity

* Ethereum is not just a company; it's a decentralized platform that revolutionizes how contracts and applications are built and function across the globe. Unlike traditional companies with a centralized governance structure, Ethereum operates on a blockchain technology foundation, emphasizing security, transparency, and decentralization.
* The project's funding through a public crowdsale reflects its community-driven approach, relying on the support and participation of developers and enthusiasts from its inception. This method of funding not only secured the financial resources needed for development but also fostered a sense of ownership and involvement among the early community.

## Business Activities
